/** **************** 2d Range Search ****************
 *  - Goal : Check if a point is in some given rectangle
 *      - search returns a rectangle containing the point(s)
 *      - insert further subdivides the plane
 * 
 *  - Solution:
 *      - recursively partition a plane into halves
 *          - even levels - partition using a  vertical   line
 *          - odd  levels - partition using an horizontal line
 *          - for vertical lines:
 *                  /      ( | )      \
 *              left of p      right of p
 *          - for horizontal lines:
 *                  /      ( _ )      \
 *              below p          above p
 * 
 *      - stop adding points once the next point makes it impossible to continue
 * 
 *  - Analysis
 *      - Typical case:                 r + log n
 *      - Worst case (when balanced):   r +   âˆš n
