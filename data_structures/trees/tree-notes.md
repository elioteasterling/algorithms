# Random Notes and maybe a thought later about Trees

## Kd Trees

A starting place for future tree understanding

### 2D tree Data Structure (k = 2, duh)

- just like a BST
- it even uses the same implementation, only;
\- key comparison is done via point comparison (K | K = some 2D Point)

### See Also

- Quad Tree (K = 4)
- BSP  Tree (K = 2 : non 90 degree partitions)

## Space-Partitioning Trees

### Applications

- ray tracing
- 2d range search
- flight simulators
- n-body simulation
- collision detection
- astronomical databi
- nearest neighbor search
- adaptive mesh generation
- accelerated rendering (in Doom)
- hidden surface removal and shadow casting
